            <h1 id="section-characters">Characters</h1>

            <p>There are two types of characters in <i>Savage Little Green Men</i>. Adjust the character to meet minimum
                requirements, if necessary. Use the core rules to create normal human characters.</p>


            <h2 id="section-extra-terrestrials">Extra-terrestrial beings (i.e., aliens)</h2>


            <p>Extra-terrestrial beings (ETs) are not human and are incapable of understanding humans, but that does
                not prevent them from studying humans, helping humans, and killing humans. All ET races will have an
                opinion about human life. They will be either positive, neutral, or negative towards humanity.</p>


            <p><b>Ancient alien:</b> These beings came to Earth in ancient times, perhaps even prehistoric times.
                They have played a crucial role in the development of humanity. What the ancient humans called gods are
                often mundane ETs.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><i>Outlook on humanity:</i> Some good, some neutral. Instances of negative opinions do not exist
                    in conspiracists' literature. In any case, even the best human channelers have problems contacting
                    these aliens, -4 to channel.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <p><b>Body snatcher:</b> Seeds from space fall to Earth and grow pod people and soon find a human body
                to invade, like a baby turtle tumbling towards the sea.
                They live for only five years and are infertile.
            <ul>
                <li><i>Outlook on humanity:</i> Negative.</li>
            </ul>

            <p><b>Flying saucer:</b> Some UFOs have no pilots. Some flying saucers are sentient beings, which may or may
                not have passengers on board.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><i>Outlook on humanity:</i> Neutral (although could be crewed by those with negative outlooks).</li>
            </ul>

            <p><b>Grey:</b> Perhaps the most commonly encountered extraterrestrial, usually the Third or Fourth Kind.
                These small spindly creatures have large oval heads; very big almond-shaped jet black eyes; and small,
                thin almost imperceptible nostrils and mouths.
            <ul>
                <li><i>Outlook on humanity:</i> Negative (humans cannot channel greys, although some are neutral).
                </li>
                <li><i>Clueless.</i> Exceptionally unaware of typical human stuff.</li>

                <li><i>Small.</i> -1 toughness.</li>

                <li><i>Arcane background (Grey).</i></li>

                <li><i>Fast healer.</i></li>
                <li><i>Low light vision.</i> Ignore penalties in Dim and Dark lighting.</li>
            </ul>


            <p><b>Little green men:</b> Another small-bodied alien. These ETs have olive-green skin and are often
                confused for greys, particularly when viewed piloting UFOs. Most little green men have two antennae on
                their foreheads. There is much debate regarding the function of these but the truth is simple.
            <ul>
                <li><i>Outlook on humanity:</i> Negative.</li>

                <li><i>Trademark weapon.</i> +1 when using ray guns.</li>
                <li><i>Sensory antennae:</i> The antennae gives the ET +2 to Notice rolls and always considered
                    active guards for Stealth checks.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                <b>Nordic alien:</b> Various alien races fall into this category because of their physical appearance
                and general abilities. They tend to ally with the greys.
            <ul>
                <li><i>Outlook on humanity:</i> Negative.</li>

                <li><i>Mean.</i> -2 charisma.</li>

                <li><i>Overconfident.</i> Believe they can do anything.</li>
            </ul>


            <p><b>Pleiadians:</b> From the Pleiades and the future.
            <ul>
                <li><i>Outlook on humanity:</i> Positive.</li>

                <li><i>Vow.</i> Pledged to save humanity.</li>
                <li><i>Racial enemy.</i> They are -4 Charisma when dealing with reptoids.</li>

                <li><i>Giant killer.</i> They like to fight reptoids and other large and nasty ET races. +1d6 damage
                    when attacking large creatures.
                </li>
            </ul>


            <p>
                <b>Reptoid:</b> They are an extraterrestrial race originating from Draco, a part of the Orion Empire.
                They ripple with negative energy and find themselves unwelcomed on Earth.
            <ul>
                <li><i>Outlook on humanity:</i> Negative.</li>

                <li><i>Ugly.</i> -2 charisma.</li>

                <li><i>Berserk.</i> The character may choose to go berserk after getting wounded instead of rolling
                    against Smarts.
                </li>

                <li><i>Brawny.</i> Toughness +1; load limit is 8 times strength instead of 5.</li>
                <li><i>Warm Natured.</i> They suffer -4 penalty to resist cold environmental effects.</li>
                <li><i>Trademark weapon.</i> +1 when using reptoid voulges.</li>
            </ul>


            <p><b>Star warrior:</b> Extraterrestrials also known as Blues. Most encounters with humans occur in the
                American Southwest, particularly with the Hopi.
            <ul>
                <li><i>Outlook on humanity:</i> Neutral.</li>

                <li><i>Honourable.</i> Always keeps their word of honour.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                <b>Tentacled monstrosity:</b> Not to be confused with the
                spaghetti god sometimes encountered on the farside of the Moon.
            <ul>
                <li><i>Outlook on humanity:</i> Neutral (utterly indifferent). All attempts to channel tentacled
                    monstrosities will
                    drive the channeler insane. Indeed, a glance towards a tentacled monstrosity turns humans insane.
                </li>

                <li><i>Bloodthirsty.</i> Never takes prisoners. -infinity charisma, always.</li>

                <li><i>Arcane background (monstrous psionics).</i></li>
            </ul>


            <h2>Terrestrial beings (i.e., humans)
            </h2>


            <p>All human beings give off energy that ETs can detect. Whether or not this energy will attract, repel, or
                be inert is determined by the nature of the individual. This manifests in different ways.
                For instance, ETs may be anything from a curiosity to an obsession;
                archaeologists, cryptozoologists, and the like may have a foot in both worlds.</p>
            <p>If the GM allows, players may choose from the following character templates.
            </p>
            <p><b>Sceptic:</b> The character is convinced that little green men and all that lunacy is a lie.
                As a result, the character always has a plausible (or acceptable) explanation for everything.
                All operations are -4 when dealing with ET phenomena which only confirms the character's suspicions.
                "Hey, I look for it all the time, never find it." The sceptic gives off enough energy to repel ETs.
                These characters are immune to abduction, and most ETs (the only exception are tentacled monstrosities)
                must make a successful gut check to get near one.</p>


            <p><b>Believer:</b> The character knows what is going on. Operates at a higher level than usual
                when dealing with ETs.
                +2 when dealing with all things ET (non-combat).
                The believer gives off negative energy which causes abductors to move on to the next victim,
                making them immune to abduction. Unfortunately, the character is also on the fringes of society,
                an outsider, and has difficulty when dealing with sceptics:
                -1 for minor sceptics, -2 for professional believers (those like Erich von Däniken).</p>

            <p><b>Confused believer:</b>
                The character knows something of the truth but believes in false explanations.
                For instance, the confused believer insists chemtrails explain the "delusions"
                and lost time of the abductee community.
                Yes, there are top-secret government programmes but that <i>that</i> sort of top-secret government
                programmes; android-people aren't real.
            </p>


            <p><b>Channel:</b>
                This is available only to human beings, although some ETs are natural channels. The character is
                in touch with the universe and one (player's choice) ET race that is either neutral or positive towards
                humanity. Channelers tend towards the fringe and could be full-blown outsiders. They are the most
                comfortable when interacting with their chosen race. They are susceptible to abduction and are a prize
                when captured because of the contents of their minds. However, they are hard to crack and gain a +1
                resistance to mind probes (but not body cavity).</p>


            <p><b>False channel:</b> These characters only think they are channels.
                They may channel a real ET race or, with the GM's approval, channel a fictional race.
                The character, of course, has no idea that none of the experience is real if they manage
                to connect with a real ET. This mental deficiency proves excellent resistance (+2);
                however, it squarely puts them on the outsider list as well.
                False channels give real channels a bad (worse?) name and over the 1000s of
                years they have been inadvertently helped perpetuate scepticism in human society and
                Western science.
            </p>


            <p><b>Exterminator:</b> A believer of sorts, however, these characters only get bonuses when confronting
                ETs. As a result, they are not outsiders (although they often hang out with outsiders).
                They welcome the opportunity for abduction because a rampage on the mother ship is the stuff of dreams
                for the exterminators. Exterminators study their foes intensely, but some races are the real focus of
                their mean streak. The player picks one negative ET and gains +2 when dealing with them in combat (this
                reflects the character's understanding of the race's weaknesses and such). Most resistant of all humans
                to body cavity probes which may buy them a few extra seconds...</p>


            <p><b>Sucker:</b> The character does not know what is truly going on and more unlucky than average when it
                comes to all things ET. As a result, the character is vulnerable to abductions and fake fortune tellers.
                However, this causes ETs and soothsayers to underestimate the character. So the character gets an extra
                benny per session for use only during an encounter with an ET or fraudulent soothsayer. It's a pure
                meta-game mechanic; in-character, the character has no idea.</p>


            <p><b>Zombified:</b> The character is no longer himself or herself. The player may select this at any time.
                The character drops all edges and hindrances and their effects and selects one of the following
                combinations.
                [TODO]
            </p>


            <h1>Encounters</h1>

            <p>
                There is a very long history encounters with aliens and little green men.
                As Earth advanced technologically, the encounters seem to have increased a great deal.</p>

            <p>
                The USSR had several flaps which are now well-known after the collapse of the Soviet regime and a
                lot of secret data kept by the KGB found its way into Western intelligence services. Also, Soviet
                scientists and researchers became known to the Western world more after the collapse.
                Some of the most famous mysteries include the Dyatlov Incident in the Ural mountains.
                Some researchers suspect an encounter with
                a tentacled monstrosity. There is also the curious case of the Manpupuner rock formations.
            </p>

            <p>
                Whenever people have any alien encounter, it's common for Men in Black to show up soon
                after that. While the description of Men in Black (they wear black suits, drive around in black cars,
                and fly around in black helicopters) is relatively new (the first use of this description occurred in
                1953 by Albert K. Bender), they have existed for thousands of years. There are many ideas about them.
                But the two most common are that they are either humans with psychic abilities are themselves ETs.
            </p>
            <p>There are other encounters. And things like crop circles, cattle mutilations, and so on.</p>


            <h2>Close encounters</h2>


            <p>Close encounters with UFOs occur within 200 metres and are classified like this:
            </p>
            <p><b>The first kind (CE-I):</b> The encounter is close, but there is no apparent interaction.</p>
            <p><b>The second kind (CE-II):</b> There is some kind of interaction with the environment.</p>
            <p><b>The third kind (CE-III):</b>
                There is an ET within the UFO. Actually, it is possible to encounter some terrestrial humans in UFOs
                but more on that later (where?). Sceptics, at least no sober ones, should probably never have a
                CE-III encounter.
            </p>
            <p><b>The fourth kind (CE-IV):</b>
                There is contact of some kind, often an abduction. Sceptics are never abducted and very rarely have
                a CE-IV encounter.
            </p>
            <h2>Abduction</h2>


            <p>The only known ET race to abduct human beings is the Grey race. Some do this out of malice while others
                do it out of pure scientific (or not) curiosity. It depends on who is funding the expedition that sends
                the group to Earth
                to gather some abductees and study them. There is another trend in human abduction and there is no lack
                of suspicion that the Greys are creating a hybrid human race, half-human and half-Grey. There are also
                any number of conspiracies believed to be behind the abductions. This includes everything from an
                agreement with human governments in exchange for space weapons to humanity being one great biological
                experiment and Earth the Grey's laboratory.</p>
            <p>It is not always true that an abductee will undergo some kind of change in life, but sometimes there are
                changes. Some effects are especially negative for a character but some are positive. A balance must be
                struck by the GM. Also most characters who do get abducted will typically
                never get abducted again. Effects should never be repeated.</p>


            <h3>Post abduction: random effects</h3>

            <p>
                Some effects are a kind of (or actually are a) edge or hindrance.
                Effects should be made as temporary as is reasonable for the game, character, etc.
            </p>


            <ol>
                <li>No apparent effect.</li>

                <li>Become afraid of probes and needles and doctors and hospitals. A guts check is required to do
                    certain things.
                </li>

                <li>Become obsessed with probing oneself, others, or both (but not necessarily at the same time).</li>

                <li>Become obsessed with cleanliness. Make a guts check against anything dirty.</li>

                <li>Become a clean freak. Make a guts check at -1 against anything dirty. The abduction experience
                    pressed profoundly the notion of cleanliness is next to godliness upon the character.
                </li>

                <li>Learn a new language (player's choice if GM defers).</li>
                <li>Begin speaking your native language with a foreign accent (player's choice if GM defers).</li>

                <li>Gain an extra benny that follows character from session to session.
                    This extra benny is available only in ET-related times and encounters.
                </li>

            <h3>Multiple abductions</h3>

            <p>
                A very small number of people are a part of a great Grey experiment and are abducted multiple times in
                their lives.
                These can occur with any frequency; days or decades may pass between abductions.
            </p>

            <h3>Consistency of abductee accounts</h3>

            <p>
                Researchers and psychologists who work with abductees have found that there are a few things in common
                in almost all cases.
                These are enumerated here.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Well adjusted.</b> The great majority of cases are reported by individuals who are,
                    psychologically, well adjusted. They do not have any kind of history otherwise with memory loss,
                    time loss, hearing voices, and so forth.
                </li>
                <li><b>Greys involved.</b> Almost all abductee accounts describe their abductors, when seen, as being a
                    part of the Grey race.
                </li>
                <li><b>Universal.</b> Researchers have found that abductees come from all walks of life from all parts
                    of the world. There are no socio-economic groups predominate. Culture and home seem to have no
                    bearing as well. While there are hot spots for abduction activity, the big picture is clear: the
                    Greys will probe anybody.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Distant encounters</h2>
            <p>Most encounters range from CE-I through and including CE-III. The nature of the encounter depends mostly
                on the nature of the alien encountered. It should be noted that CE-IV are rare and almost never occur to
                sceptic characters.</p>

            <h2>Mental effects</h2>

            <p>Most humans do not interact with aliens in a healthy manner. The GM may want to use this to determine
                the effects of a particularly traumatic CE-IV encounter. Any attempt to channel a tentacled
                monstrosity is going to always result in at least one major effect (cosmic insanity turns the character
                into a drooling, quivering, sometimes catatonic pile of biomass, roll up a new character); even seeing a
                tentacled monstrosity could
                yield a minor (or major) effect.
                Repeats go from minor to major, or roll again.

                <h1>Skills</h1>


                <p><b>Knowledge (Ufology).</b> The character has knowledge of Ufology; this includes information about
                    the races, history, conspiracy theories, current developments, and so forth.


                    <i>Optional:</i> The GM may allow (or require) characters to gain specialisation
                    by selecting a Knowledge skill for each ET race.</p>
                <p><b>Knowledge (Tentacled monstrosity).</b> The character is well versed in the lore of tentacled
                    monstrosities and the various cults worshiping them.</p>


                <p><b>Theoretical alien tech.</b>
                    The character knows information about alien technology. This is purely theoretical knowledge. The
                    character may or may not have ever actually seen any alien tech (except for sketches and drawings).
                    Characters who gain practical knowledge of alien tech can only do by picking up the <i>applied alien
                        tech</i>
                    skill.</p>


                <p><b>Applied alien tech.</b>
                    The character knows how to use most bits of alien technology.
                    This allows the character to use mind wipes, shoot ray guns, and even
                    co-pilot flying saucers.
                    Note, however, that the character cannot fly the craft;
                    the character only knows how to read and interact with
                    the instrument panels in the crafts. There is an exception as some UFOs are flied by mental
                    symbiotic links with the pilot and this requires Grey psionics. Finally, no human being has ever
                    been able to interpret the digital
                    read out on alien body cavity probes. The practical result of this is that even with this skill the
                    character cannot interpret the digital output on the probes. Not even channelers have ever been
                    able to get an explanation. Greys held in secret facilities have been asked (politely and not so
                    politely) about them for decades to no avail.
                    It's almost as if the Greys cannot explain it themselves.</p>


                <p><b>Pilot (Flying saucer).</b>
                    The character knows how to fly a flying saucer.
                    Requires either Theoretical (3 ranks) or Applied (2 ranks) alien tech skills. The exception is, of
                    course, those crafts which require a psionic link with the pilot as is the case with some of the
                    Greys' crafts.</p>


                <p><b>Xenobiology.</b>
                    The character has acquired knowledge of alien biology to the
                    point of being able to make medical diagnostics and treatments.
                    But it never is as easy as other skills.
                    The character operates at one die type lower than the actual die type.
                    That means a character with d4 cannot use the skill until it is at d6.
                    That means a character with d12 uses the skill at d10, until another
                    rank pushes the type to d12.</p>

                <p><b>Starting powers:</b> 1.</p>
                <p>The channeler can only select from the following channeling powers.</p>

                <h3>Channeling Powers</h3>
                <p><b>Channel Alien</b></p>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Rank:</b> Novice.</li>
                    <li><b>Power points:</b> 2.</li>
                    <li><b>Range:</b> Intergalactic.</li>
                    <li><b>Duration:</b> Alien's choice.</li>
                    <li><b>Trappings:</b> Trance.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>The character is able to make some contact. If the channeler knows specific aliens, they may be
                    channeled with a +1 bonus. Upon reaching Veteran status, channeling known aliens costs no power
                    points. If the channeler aces an attempt, then that alien is automatically considered to be known
                    for future attempts at channeling. The alien may or may not respond well to that.
                </p>
                <p>Rolling a 1 on the channeling die regardless of the Wild Die means that the channeler becomes
                    Shaken and has made contact with the exact opposite ET race being attempted. If there no specific ET
                    race being attempted, then it's something nasty like a reptoid in a terrible mood or perhaps a grey
                    who schedules the channeler for abduction. Greys can become quite interested in what makes a
                    channeler tick; probes will be necessary.
                </p>

                <p><b>Channel Ancient Alien</b></p>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Rank:</b> Heroic.</li>
                    <li><b>Power points:</b> 10.</li>
                    <li><b>Range:</b> Intergalactic (possibly cosmic).</li>
                    <li><b>Duration:</b> Alien's choice.</li>
                    <li><b>Trappings:</b> Burning intoxicating herbs and incense for a few minutes and most definitely
                        inhaling.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>Heroic characters are -6 to successfully channel an Ancient Alien. Legendary characters are -4 to
                    channel one. If the channel rolls a 1 regardless of the Wild Die that means the channeler becomes
                    Shaken, which is actually the good news; the bad news is that the channeler ends up channeling a
                    tentacled monstrosity. And some greys somewhere probably schedule the channeler for probing.</p>

                <p>Accidentally channelling a tentacled monstrosity will always result in a major effect.
                    Intentionally channelling a tentacled monstrosity will always result in cosmic insanity&mdash;new PC

                <h2>Arcane Background (Grey)</h2>

                <p><b>Starting power points:</b> 15.</p>
                <p><b>Starting powers:</b> 3.</p>

                <p>The grey can select any power for which they meet the rank requirements. However, greys do tend to
                    favour powers that are useful in abductions.
                    Greys may also choose from the following powers.</p>

                <h3>Grey Psionic Powers</h3>
                <p><b>False Memory</b></p>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Rank:</b> Seasoned.</li>
                    <li><b>Power points:</b> 4.</li>
                    <li><b>Range:</b> Touch.</li>
                    <li><b>Duration:</b> The victim's life time.</li>
                    <li><b>Trappings:</b> Glowing index finger pad.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>It is not known why the Greys like to implant false memories in the heads of abductees. They just do.
                    It could be an experiment or an attempt to mask the true experience the abductee experiences.
                    Sometimes the false memory is kind of weird because aliens are not humans and despite the extensive
                    experiments they still do not under humans fully.</p>

                <p>The character who has been implanted with a false memory can never shake it. There are, however,
                    moments of clarity. A successful Spirit check can cause the character to doubt the memory but never
                    fully shake it. These checks should occur if the memory figures prominently in the scene. Also, if
                    the character aces the roll then the moment of clarity lasts for d4 hours but then fades away and
                    the character is back to total false memory land.</p>

                <p>Note that sceptics are +1 against False Memory at all times.</p>

                <h1>Gear</h1>


                <h2>Items</h2>


                <p><b>Body cavity probe:</b> A simple somewhat bullet-shaped
                    device with a sleek brushed metallic design which anyone can use;
                    however, only a Grey can successfully interpret the digital output.
                    Most are 25-cm long.</p>


                <p><b>The Helmet:</b> This is the term that comes from the abductee community. The term is used
                    independently and appears in abductee testimonies. The device is a large helmet (due to the Grey's
                    large heads) that has a series of tubes and wires streaming from it that are plugged into another
                    device that is fitted over the head of another. The device is used for mind reading as well as to
                    send out thoughts, memories, and suggestions. This is the only known way to tap into the human
                    subconsciousness. Amazing stuff. Humans are pretty good recipients but if they manage to capture one
                    they do not know how to use it too well. They are -4 (alien technologists are -3) to be successful
                    and a natural 1 means the failure is both automatic and invokes the Law of Unintended Consequences.
                    The GM gets to make the call, unless the Player offers something entertaining.</p>


                <p><b>Tin foil hat:</b> For most people these are just silly. However, they do work. Any character with
                    outsider hindrance gets +2 defence while a believer gets +3 defense against mind probes. It does
                    nothing against physical probes, however, or cosmic insanity.</p>

                    <b>Ray gun:</b> This is a strange laser pistol. Its power source seems to be life itself! In the
                    hands of little green men and reptoids (the aggressive ET races) the damage is 3d6+2. In the hands
                    of exterminators 3d4+1. In the hands of anyone else the damage is always 2. It has armour
                    penetration value of 2 as well. Rate of fire is 2. Range is pretty darn good.

                    <b>Reptoid voulge:</b> This is a very large voulge which is wielded by reptoid warriors. Damage is
                    Str+d12. Weight is 25.
